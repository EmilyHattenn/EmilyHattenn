## Research 
I took part in two undergraduate research experiences at Furman University, both involved computational work within the physics' department.

### Analyzing Eclisping Catacysmic Variable Star Systems 



### Computationally Simulating the Light-Matter Interactions between UltraShort Laser Pulses and Semiconductor Nanowires in 3D
